# Gateway cluster
{: #cr-orderinginstance-edge}

 An edge gateway is required. You can bring your own gateway appliance or choose from one of the following.

 * Gateway cluster with Juniper® vSRX
 * Gateway cluster with FortiGate® Virtual Appliance
 * FortiGate Security Appliance

 The gateway cluster is deployed in the same data center as the consolidated cluster.

The gateway cluster is available for all firewall appliances except for **FortiGate Security Appliance**.

The data center of the consolidated cluster must be available for gateway cluster deployment. Gateway cluster deployment is not supported for **Dallas 09**.
